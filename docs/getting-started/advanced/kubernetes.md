# Running PhotoPrism with Kubernetes

Running PhotoPrism on a Kubernetes cluster is straightforward.

At a minimum, you can just define a Kubernetes `Service` and a `StatefulSet` and be up and running.
For more real-world usage, you'll probably want to at least include persistent storage,
and possibly some `Ingress` rules for exposing PhotoPrism outside your cluster.

For those familiar with [Helm](https://helm.sh), a PhotoPrism Helm chart [is available](https://github.com/p80n/photoprism-helm).

Once you've got PhotoPrism deployed, you can `exec` into the running container and `photoprism import` your photos.

Here's an [example of a YAML file](../../developer-guide/technologies/yaml.md) that creates the
following Kubernetes objects:

- `Namespace`
- `Service` exposing PhotoPrism on port 80
- `StatefulSet` with persistent NFS volumes
- `Secret` which stores the database DSN and admin password
- `Ingress` rule for a Kubernetes [ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/)
- Annotations for a Kubernetes [`Certificate Manager`](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager)

```

To run this locally, you can use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
or a similar local cluster deployer.

Once your cluster is up and running with your `kubectl` commands. Simply copy the above YAML
markup to a file, make the necessary changes, and use the `kubectl` CLI command to deploy:

```bash
kubectl create -f photoprism.yaml
```

If you prefer to use helm, see https://github.com/p80n/photoprism-helm.
